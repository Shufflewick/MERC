# Milestone v2.1: Expansion Dictators

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-17
**Phases:** 56-62
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

Add 9 expansion dictators (Gaddafi, Hitler, Hussein, Mao, Mussolini, Noriega, Pinochet, Pol Pot, Stalin) to the game, each with unique abilities across per-turn, setup, persistent, and reactive categories. Phases ordered by implementation complexity, starting with data foundation and progressing through ability tiers from simple hire patterns to complex interactive and reactive mechanics.

## Phases

### Phase 56: Data Foundation

**Goal**: All 9 expansion dictators exist in the game data and players can select any dictator during setup.
**Depends on**: None (foundation phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 56-01: Add 9 expansion dictators to combatants.json, lobby dropdown, and DictatorAbilityType

---

### Phase 57: Simple Hire Abilities

**Goal**: Gaddafi and Stalin can hire MERCs each turn, following the established Castro pattern.
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 57-01: AI-path functions, human-path actions, and registration for Gaddafi and Stalin
- [x] 57-02: Flow step and UI wiring for both hire actions

---

### Phase 58: Setup-Phase Abilities

**Goal**: Hussein, Mao, and Mussolini modify game state during setup, and Hussein's persistent double-tactics works each turn.
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 58-01: Setup abilities for Hussein (extra tactics), Mao and Mussolini (bonus MERCs with squad choice)
- [x] 58-02: Hussein per-turn double tactics with post-effects and UI wiring

---

### Phase 59: Militia Placement Abilities

**Goal**: Mao, Mussolini, and Pol Pot place militia each turn following patterns similar to Kim's existing militia ability.
**Depends on**: Phase 56, Phase 58
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 59-01: Mao multi-sector wilderness militia distribution (AI + human + flow loop)
- [x] 59-02: Mussolini two-step militia place and spread (AI + human + flow loops)
- [x] 59-03: Pol Pot rebel sector militia with conditional MERC hire on combat loss

---

### Phase 60: Complex Interactive Abilities

**Goal**: Hitler and Noriega execute multi-step interactive abilities each turn.
**Depends on**: Phase 57
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 60-01: Hitler hire + persistent initiative target override (AI + human + combat.ts hook)
- [x] 60-02: Noriega militia conversion, placement, and conditional hire (AI + human + multi-step flow)

---

### Phase 61: Reactive Abilities

**Goal**: Gaddafi, Pinochet, and Pol Pot respond to game events with triggered abilities.
**Depends on**: Phase 57, Phase 59
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 61-01: Pinochet per-turn damage spread and sector-loss reactive hire (AI + human + snapshot mechanism)
- [x] 61-02: Gaddafi equipment loot on rebel MERC kill (combat hooks + post-combat flow)

---

### Phase 62: AI & Comprehensive Testing

**Goal**: AI can play as any of the 9 expansion dictators, and all abilities have test coverage.
**Depends on**: Phases 57-61
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 62-01: Extract shared test helpers and unit test all 9 per-turn abilities
- [x] 62-02: Unit test setup abilities (Mao, Mussolini, Hussein) and reactive abilities (Gaddafi, Pinochet, Pol Pot)
- [x] 62-03: Integration tests: AI plays full game as each of 9 expansion dictators

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- sortByInitiative takes optional game parameter for Hitler initiative override (backward compatible)
- Hitler initiative target pick is a separate flow step after hire step
- Noriega AI sector strategy: prefer non-rebel sector with most adjacent rebel sectors
- Pinochet damage spread: MERCs first then militia for remainder allocation; no Gaddafi loot trigger
- Gaddafi loot uses BoardSmith element ID (number) for discard pile lookup, not equipment string ID
- Dictator ability unit tests use createTestGame + setupDictator('id') pattern with isAI=true
- Two-path ability architecture: AI auto-execute + human interactive flow for all dictators

**Issues Resolved:**

- None — clean implementation across all 7 phases

**Issues Deferred:**

- Vendor tarballs missing compiled `dist` folders — blocks build and integration tests
- Stale comment in GameTable.vue:618 references removed state machine (cosmetic)
- Stale comment in combat.ts:72 references "theatre view system" (cosmetic)
- `detonateExplosives` action missing AI batch gate (win-game action, extremely rare)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — no TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, or stub patterns found.
