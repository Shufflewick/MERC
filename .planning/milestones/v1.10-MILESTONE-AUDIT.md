| Generalissimo → pick MERC → equip with bandolier handling | COMPLETE |
| Lockdown → militia placed → rebel moves in with landmine | COMPLETE |
| Better Weapons buff → combat with 3+ threshold | COMPLETE |

**Score: 5/5 flows verified**

## Anti-Patterns

None found across all four phases. No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, placeholders, or debug logging.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. All four phases are clean.

## Human Verification Items

The following items require manual gameplay testing:

1. **Landmine detonation animation** — visual feedback when mine triggers
2. **Squidhead disarm message** — verify game.message() provides adequate player feedback
3. **Dictator landmine trigger** — bidirectional logic works in actual gameplay
4. **Hospital/Arms Dealer auto-fill** — single-unit auto-selection from sector panel
5. **Tactics card banner overlay** — red banner appears and auto-dismisses
6. **Generalissimo interactive flow** — 3-step MERC/equipment/sector selection
7. **Lockdown interactive flow** — iterative militia placement loop
