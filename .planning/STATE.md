## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions captured in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Deferred Issues

- Vendor tarballs missing compiled `dist` folders - blocks build and integration tests
- Stale comment in GameTable.vue:618 references removed state machine (cosmetic)
- Stale comment in combat.ts:72 references "theatre view system" (cosmetic)
- `detonateExplosives` action missing AI batch gate (win-game action, extremely rare)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
